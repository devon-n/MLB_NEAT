An AI model that uses Keras predictions that are fed into a NEAT framework to make betting decisions


The model scrapes tomorrows games and combines them with past statistics and Keras predictions.

NEAT makes bets based on these and compares them with tomorrows results.

All results are kept and a daily report is sent to the email address in creds.txt
